    </div>

    <div class="about-container">
        <p>I'm a creative individual with a passion for both software development and photography. While I'm currently a beginner in the world of coding, I'm fascinated by the potential to build something tangible from scratch using code. I'm diving into the fundamentals of programming, particularly in areas of development like web development and hope to build a mobile and desktop app in the future with the knowledge gained. Learning to translate ideas into functional code is incredibly motivating. </p> <br>

        <p>On the other hand, I find a different kind of creative outlet through photography. Capturing the world through a lens allows me to express myself visually. Whether it's the beauty of nature, the energy of a city, or the emotions on a person's face, I love finding ways to tell a story through a single image.</p> <br>

        <p> The eye for detail and composition I hone as a photographer translates surprisingly well to my coding. It helps me write clean, well-structured code, ensuring each piece fits together harmoniously like the elements in a photograph.</p> <br> 

        <p>I'm constantly seeking ways to learn and grow in both fields. The tech community thrives on collaboration, and I'm eager to connect with experienced developers. As for photography, I'm always pushing myself to explore new techniques and experiment with different styles. </p><br>
        
        <p>Ultimately, I hope to bridge the gap between these two worlds. Perhaps I can develop an app for photographers or create a visually stunning website. The possibilities are endless! In the future, I aspire to not only continue learning but also contribute my knowledge and skills to both the coding and photography communities.</p>
